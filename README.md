# datahack
In a hackathon hosted by UCSD's DS3 club, I grouped up with three classmates against 20-30 other groups
to produce the best analysis possible on the given religious texts data within the set time frame. This
time frame was 40 hours. We worked tirelessly and learned much along the way. We were rewarded with our
project coming in second place! This project contains simple sorting methods, TF_IDF and random forest
classifier algorithms, visualizations via Tableau and matplotlib, and ingenious hypothesis testing.
